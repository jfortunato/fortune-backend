# Getting Started

A server is required to run your application. Fortunately PHP 5.4+ comes with a
development server that is very easy to get started with. Just navigate into the
`public` directory using your terminal and start the server from there.

    cd public/
    php -S localhost:8000

Now just navigate to http://localhost:8000 using your web browser to view the main page.

> You can also use a full-fledged server such as Apache or Nginx
